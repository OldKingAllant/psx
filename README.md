# psx
Ps1 emulator with focus on learning Dynamic Recompilation, Fastmem and Memory mirroring, plus how an hardware renderer should be implemented

# Note
Development is not, in fact, started (yet). For now this repository will contain only useful pieces that should be used to build the real project.

# Roadmap
<ol>
  <li>Understand how fastmem and backpatching should work (more or less DONE)</li>
  <li>Understand the memory map of the PS1 and how to represented through memory mirroring (IMPORTANT, if I don't understand this, fastmem cannot be implemented)</li>
  <li>Understand how to translate MIPS1 to x64 (fow now only x64) (keeping in mind that we would like to implemented fastmem + backpatching with it)</li>
  <li>The real project</li>
</ol>
